# AIPictionary

This project started as a final project for the University of Massachusetts Boston Computer Science capstone course, CS410: Introduction to Software Development. The project was developed by a team of  students, and the goal was to create a game of AI pictionary where prompts will generate AI-created images for other players to guess.

We will be developing this application further in the future.
